# House-Value-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
House value prediction uses machine learning to estimate property prices based on various features such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, age of the property, and neighborhood characteristics. By analyzing historical property data, machine learning models like linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods (e.g., random forests and gradient boosting) can identify patterns that influence house prices.

Accurate house value prediction is valuable in real estate, helping buyers, sellers, and agents make informed decisions. This approach also supports automated valuation systems for mortgage lending and investment, offering a data-driven alternative to traditional appraisal methods.
